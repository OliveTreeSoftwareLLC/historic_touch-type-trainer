Typing web app (client for Teacher's Trading Post server software)

## Development Setup

For developing, you must install [iojs](https://iojs.org/en/index.html).

After checkout out the source code from Github, open a command prompt in the
source code directory. Run `npm install` to install all the neccessary
dependencies.

To run the development server, run `npm start`. This will start the server on
port 8090 and recompile all neccessary files when the source files are
modified. Visit http://localhost:8090/app in a web browser to run the application.
